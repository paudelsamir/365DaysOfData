## [2024/12/14 - 2024/12/24]


I have [**intermediate proficiency**](https://github.com/paudelsamir/python-mastery) in **Python** and have completed several [**basic to advanced EDA projects**](https://github.com/paudelsamir/EDA-Projects). I am already familiar with **Statistics** and **Mathematics**, so my focus now is on revisiting these topics with a **practical, data-driven approach**.


## Day 01 
![importance of linear algebra](img/importance_of_linear_algebra.png)
Today, I learned about Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensorsâ€”key data structures in ML. explored Linear combinations and Span, used in algorithms like Linear Regression. I also studied the Determinant, important for matrix invertibility in solving equations.

## Day 02
<!-- covered the Dot Product and Cross Product, useful in algorithms like SVMs and Neural Networks. I touched on Cramer's Rule for solving linear systems and 3D Transformations in computer vision. I also looked into Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors for PCA, SVD, and the Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse for regression. -->
