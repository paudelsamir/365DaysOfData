> Before starting this challenge, I built [**intermediate proficiency**](https://github.com/paudelsamir/python-mastery) in **Python** through practice and [**EDA projects**](https://github.com/paudelsamir/EDA-Projects). I also spent a month exploring **Data Science**, logging my progress in the [**30DaysOfData**](https://github.com/paudelsamir/30DaysOfData-LearningUtsav) repository. With a solid foundation in Statistics and Mathematics, I’m excited to embark on this journey. Let’s begin!

data only comes with input x, but not output labels y. Algorithm has to find structure in data.
![Unsupervised Learinging](01-Supervised-Learning/images/day2_supervisedvsunsupervised.gif)
- Clustering: group similar data points together <br>
![alt text](./01-Supervised-Learning/images/clustering.png)

# Day 06: Cost Function:
![alt text](./01-Supervised-Learning/images/costfunction.jpg)
Visualization of cost function:
![Visualization of cost function](./01-Supervised-Learning/images/visualization_costfunction.png)

- manually reading these contour plot is not effective or correct, as the complexity increases, we need an algorithm which figures out the values w, b (parameters) to get the best fit time, minimizing cost function

[Notebook: Model Representation](./01-Supervised-Learning/code/day04_model_representation.ipynb)

*Gradient descent is an algorithm which does this task*

# Day 08: Effect of learning Rate, Cost function and Data on GD
- learning rate on GD:Affects the step size; too high can overshoot, too low can slow convergence

<!-- ![alt text](./01-Supervised-Learning/images/learningrate_eg2.png) -->
- cost function on GD:Smooth, convex functions help faster convergence; complex ones may trap in local minima

- Data on GD:Quality and scaling affect stability; more data improves gradient estimates

# Day10: Feature Scaling
[Lab2: Multiple Variable](./01-Supervised-Learning/code/day09_Lab02_Multiple_Variable_Soln.ipynb)

Today, I learned about feature scaling and how it helps improve predictions. There are multiple methods for feature scaling, including
- Min-Max Scaling
- Mean Normalization
- Z-Score Normalization
![alt text](./01-Supervised-Learning/images/notesfeature_scaling.png
)
To ensure proper convergence:
check the learning curve to confirm the loss is decreasing.
Start with a small learning rate and gradually increase to find the optimal value.

# Day 11: Feature engineering and Polynomial Regression
feature engineering improves features to better predict the target.

eg If we need to predict the cost of flooring and have length and breadth of the room as features, we can use feature engineering to create a new feature, area (length × breadth), which directly impacts the flooring cost.

<img src="./01-Supervised-Learning/images/notes_featureengineering.jpg" width = "400">
![alt text](01-Supervised-Learning/images/notes_featureengineering.jpg)

explored polynomial regression that models the relationship between variables as a polynomial curve instead of a straight line

**Equation:**  
y = b₀ + b₁x + b₂x² + ... + bₙxⁿ 
It is useful for capturing nonlinear relationships in data.

# Day 12: Linear Regression using Scikit Learn
Had a productive session with linear regression in scikit learn. The lab helped me get a better grasp of the process, though I need more practice with tuning models. Also revisited the Scikit-Learn models ,more comfortable with them now

- Scikit-learn is an open-source Python library used for machine learning that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis, including algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

# Day 13: Classification

![alt text](01-Supervised-Learning/images/code-snapshot_GD_LR.png)
<br>
[Notebook: Classification solution](./01-Supervised-Learning/code/day13_Classification_Soln.ipynb)

- Classification is the process of categorizing items into different groups based on shared characteristics, like classifying tumors into benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) based on their growth behavior and potential to spread.
![](./01-Supervised-Learning/images/example_of_lr_on_categoricaldata.png)
The example above demonstrates that the linear model is insufficient to model categorical data. The model can be extended as described in the following lab.

# Day 14: Logistic Regression, Sigmoid Function

- Logistic Regression: A classification algorithm used to predict probabilities of binary outcomes.
![Logistic regression on categorical data](01-Supervised-Learning/images/day14_egoflogisticrregression.png)
- Sigmoid Function: A mathematical function that maps any input to a value between 0 and 1, used in logistic regression to model probabilities.

# Day 17: Underfitting, Overfitting


Today, explored teh concepts, overfitting (high variance), underfitting (high bias) and generalization(just right). 
Regularization to reduce Overfitting. Explored Regularized logistic regression.
- If the data is in non linear behaviour then we have to appply Ml algos like decision tree, random forest and svm.

Explored hypermeters of logistic regression, and gained some knowledge.

# Day 18: Neurons, Layer, Neural netowrk, forward propagation
- neural network: 
neural networks are machine learning algorithms that model complex patterns using multiple hidden layers and non-linear activation functions. they take inputs, pass them through hidden layers of neurons, and output a prediction.
![alt text](02-Advanced-Learning-Algorithms/images/day18_NeuralNetowkr.png) 

- Neurons:
a neuron takes weighted inputs, applies an activation function, and outputs a result. inputs can be features or outputs from previous neurons, with weights adjusting their influence.
![alt text](02-Advanced-Learning-Algorithms/images/day18_single_neuroninaction.gif)
fig: single neuron in action

- Synapse: 
synapses connect neurons and carry the weighted inputs. each connection has a weight that adjusts during training.

- weights: 
weights control the strength of connections between neurons. they are multiplied by inputs to influence the output, and are adjusted during training.

Popular activation functions include relu and sigmoid.

- Bias: 
bias is a constant added to the weighted input before applying the activation function, helping the model represent patterns that don’t pass through the origin.

- Layers: 
![alt text](02-Advanced-Learning-Algorithms/images/day18_Layers.png) 
  - **input layer**: holds the data for the model, with each neuron representing an attribute.
  - **hidden layer**: applies activation functions to the inputs and passes results to the next layer.
  - **output layer**: receives input from the last hidden layer and returns the model’s prediction.


---
# Day 19: Forward Propagation
- Forward Propagation: Input data is “forward propagated” through the network layer by layer to the final layer which outputs a prediction.
``` python
# x is the input to the network. 
def relu(z):
    return max(0,z)

def feed_forward(x, Wh, Wo):
    # Hidden layer
    Zh = x * Wh
    H = relu(Zh)

    # Output layer
    Zo = H * Wo
    output = relu(Zo)
    return output

```

[Notebook: A small Neural Netowrk using tensoflow](02-Advanced-Learning-Algorithms/code/day19_NN_CoffeeRoasting_TF.ipynb)


- **tensorflow basics**:
    - **representation of data**:numpy arrays used for input (e.g., 2D arrays).
        
        ```python
        python
        Copy code
        x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
        
        ```
        
    - **building a neural network**:
        1. define layers:
            
            ```python
            python
            Copy code
            layer1 = dense(units=25, activation='sigmoid')
            layer2 = dense(units=15, activation='sigmoid')
            layer3 = dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
            
            ```
            
        2. stack layers in a model:
            
            ```python
            python
            Copy code
            model = sequential([layer1, layer2, layer3])
            
            ```
            
        3. compile and train:
            
            ```python
            python
            Copy code
            model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
            model.fit(x, y, epochs=10)
            
            ```
            
    - **visualization**:neurons connect layer by layer, with weights and biases computed at each step (refer to attached gif).
