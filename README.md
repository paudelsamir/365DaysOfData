# 365DaysOfData
A repository for tracking my learning and progress with Data. 

![cover](./resources/img/cover.png)

Before starting this challenge, I already had [**intermediate proficiency**](https://github.com/paudelsamir/python-mastery) in **Python** and had worked on several basic to advanced [**EDA projects**](https://github.com/paudelsamir/EDA-Projects). Iâ€™m also familiar with **Statistics** and **Mathematics**, so now my goal is to revisit these topics with a **practical, data-driven focus**.
<br><br>
*And so, the #365DaysofData journey begins!*
