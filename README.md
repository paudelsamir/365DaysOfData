> Before starting this challenge, I already had [**intermediate proficiency**](https://github.com/paudelsamir/python-mastery) in **Python** and had worked on several basic to advanced [**EDA projects**](https://github.com/paudelsamir/EDA-Projects). Iâ€™m also familiar with **Statistics** and **Mathematics**
