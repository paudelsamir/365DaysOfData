This is a structured learning path following the [CampusX FastAPI for Machine Learning YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJKsPchji0Q&list=PLKnIA16_RmvZ41tjbKB2ZnwchfniNsMuQ).


# Day 1: What is an API? | Introduction to APIs | FastAPI for Machine Learning

- apis = connectors between frontend and backend, like waiter passing orders
![alt text](images/api.png)
- monolithic = tightly coupled, bad for scaling or sharing data externally

- api-based = decoupled, clean and scalable, easy to integrate with others

- irctc case = real-world pain of monoliths, fixed by exposing api endpoints

- http + json = universal protocol + format for backend/frontend communication

- multi-platform needs (web/android/ios) make apis essential to avoid duplicating backend logic

- in ml systems, model = new backend, apis serve predictions like dbs serve data

- fastapi = modern python framework, async support, fast, auto docs, perfect for ml model deployment

- main use-case = wrapping models and making them usable via web or 3rd-party apps
