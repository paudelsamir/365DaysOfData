**Computer Vision (CV):**
- **Image Classification:** Techniques like CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and ViT (Vision Transformers) for categorizing images.
- **Object Detection:** Methods such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and SSD for locating and identifying objects within images.
- **Semantic & Instance Segmentation:** Models like UNet and Mask R-CNN for pixel-level classification and distinguishing individual objects.
- **Pose Estimation & Tracking:** Approaches including OpenPose and HRNet for detecting human poses and tracking movement.
- **3D Vision / Depth Estimation:** Algorithms such as PointNet and NeRF for understanding 3D structures and estimating depth from images.
- **Optical Flow & Video Analysis:** Techniques for analyzing motion and changes across video frames.
- **Specialized Domains:** Applications in medical imaging, satellite imagery, and autonomous driving.

**Generative AI:**
- **Image Generation:** Models like GANs, diffusion models, and Stable Diffusion for creating new images.
- **Image-to-Image / Video Generation:** Tools such as Vid2Vid and ControlNet for transforming images or videos from one style or domain to another.
- **Super-resolution, Inpainting, Denoising:** Methods to enhance image quality, fill missing regions, or remove noise.
- **Text-to-Image / Multimodal Generation:** Systems like DALLÂ·E and Imagen for generating images from text descriptions or combining multiple data types.
