# 12 - LLM Systems and Scaling

this folder captures the journey beyond building models:  
from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agents, and prompt engineering,  
to deployment, quantization, competitions, and monetization.

## roadmap overview

- vector databases and RAG-based chatbots  
- autonomous LLM agents with tool use and memory  
- backend APIs and dockerized model deployment  
- model compression and quantized fine-tuning  
- participation in competitions with real datasets  
- research-level projects with custom training and reports  
- building portfolio-ready tools and monetization strategies

## goal  
build scalable, real-world AI systems that solve problems and generate impact.
