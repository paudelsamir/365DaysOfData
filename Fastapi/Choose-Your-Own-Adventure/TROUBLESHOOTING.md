welcome to the choose-your-own-adventure api project! this fastapi app generates interactive stories using the ollama llm and stores data in an sqlite database. while building the project, you might run into some common issues—i’ve faced several myself, so i’ll share them here. knowing these can save you a lot of time and help you fix problems quickly if they pop up.

the most frequent problem is getting generic fallback stories instead of ai-generated content. this typically happens due to configuration issues like invalid ollama url settings (e.g., `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434s` with an extra 's'), pydantic model mismatches, or json parsing failures with markdown code blocks. direct http requests to the ollama api often work better than using wrappers:

```python
response = requests.post(f"{ollama_base_url}/api/generate", 
                        json=ollama_request, timeout=30)
```

to verify your setup is working correctly, check your configuration with `grep OLLAMA_BASE_URL .env`, ensure ollama is running with `ollama serve` and `ollama pull llama3.2`, and test story generation using curl for easy debugging like this...

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/stories/create \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"theme": "space adventure"}'
```

setting up the development environment is straightforward. install dependencies with `uv sync`, start ollama with the commands above, then run the fastapi server with `python main.py` from the backend directory. remember that environment variables matter enormously - one typo can break entire integrations, and llm response formats vary widely, so always handle markdown wrappers and extra text in your parsing logic.
