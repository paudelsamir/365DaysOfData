       "'Based on the provided context from the Bhagavad Gita, lust is described as the greatest enemy of living entities and the primary cause of their entanglement in the material world.\\n\\nLust is said to be the manifestation of the mode of passion (raja-guña) within an individual. When a living entity comes into contact with the material creation, their eternal love for Kåñëa (the Supreme Personality of Godhead) is transformed into lust, driven by their senses (indriyāëi), mind (manaù), and intelligence (buddhiù).\\n\\nLust is characterized as an all-devouring sinful enemy that can never be satisfied by material sense gratification. It is said to \"cover\" or \"overwhelm\" the embodied soul (dehinam), preventing them from attaining true knowledge (jïänam) and spiritual realization.\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita teaches that when lust is not transformed into love for the Supreme, it can lead to a cycle of craving, dissatisfaction, and ultimately, wrath. However, when an individual transforms their lustful propensities into a love for Kåñëa, or desires everything for Kåñëa, both lust and wrath can be spiritualized.\\n\\nIn this context, the Bhagavad Gita suggests that by cultivating a sense of devotion (bhakti) to Kåñëa, one can transcend the limitations of lust and attain liberation from the material world.'"
