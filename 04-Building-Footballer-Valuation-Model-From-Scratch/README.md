Inspired by [Youla Sozen’s work](https://github.com/youlasozen/predicting-the-Market-Value-of-Footballers).

Refer to my separate repository [ML-Based-Football-Players-Market-Value-Prediction](https://github.com/paudelsamir/ML-Based-Football-Players-Market-Value-Prediction) for setup instructions, dataset details, and training guidelines.
