Inspired by the work of [Youla Sozen](https://github.com/youlasozen/predicting-the-Market-Value-of-Footballers)

Every project starts with a problem or question. However, this project is different. it's all about having fun. As a football enthusiast, creating these kinds of projects is always enjoyable. The plan is straightforward, and I will implement it step by step.

### Project plan

Although this is a fun project, i aim to ensure the following:

- **accurate player valuation**: estimating market values to benefit clubs, agents, and investors.
- **transfer market efficiency**: preventing overpayment, aiding negotiation, and optimizing resource allocation.
- **risk assessment & player development**: evaluating investments while identifying young talents with high growth potential.
- **data-driven insights**: supporting fairer contract negotiations and improving decision-making in fantasy football & betting.

this is a future plan, and i will work towards achieving these goals in the coming days.
